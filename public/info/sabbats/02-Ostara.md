## Overview

Welcome, springtime wanderers! Ostara (oh-STAH-rah) is an age-old festival that celebrates the arrival of spring, encapsulating the spirit of rejuvenation, rebirth, and vibrant new growth. It synchronizes with the vernal or spring equinox, a time when the day and night share equal lengths.

## What is the Origin of Ostara?

The origin of Ostara, a festival marking the spring equinox, is rooted in Germanic traditions and mythology. Ostara derives its name from Eostre (or Ostara), a goddess associated with spring and possibly dawn, as mentioned by the Venerable Bede, an 8th-century English monk.

‚ÄúEosturmonath,‚Äù was named after her, indicating a time for festivals and celebrations in her honor.

## What is the Vernal Equinox?

The term ‚Äúvernal equinox‚Äù is another name for the spring equinox, and it comes from the Latin word ‚Äúvernal,‚Äù which means ‚Äúpertaining to spring.‚Äù The word
‚Äúvernal‚Äù is derived from the Latin ‚Äúver,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúspring.‚Äù Thus, ‚Äúvernal equinox‚Äù directly translates to ‚Äúspring equinox.‚Äù
In astronomical terms, the equinox occurs when the plane of Earth‚Äôs equator passes through the center of the Sun. This event happens twice a year, marking the start of spring and autumn. The spring (or vernal) equinox is the moment in the year when the Sun crosses the celestial equator, moving northward, and results in nearly equal day and night across the entire Earth. This equinox typically occurs around March 20th or 21st in the Northern Hemisphere and signifies the start of the spring season.
The use of ‚Äúvernal‚Äù is more common in scientific and formal contexts, whereas
‚Äúspring‚Äù is more commonly used in everyday language. Both terms refer to the same astronomical event and are used interchangeably.
