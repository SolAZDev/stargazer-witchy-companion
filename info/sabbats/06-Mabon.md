## The Origins of Mabon

Did you know that the balance of day and night could bring such deep reflections and festivities? Mabon, the pagan holiday celebrated at the Autumn Equinox, intertwines the rich traditions of ancient harvest festivals with unique modern pagan interpretations. Although its name sounds steeped in ancient mythology, the title “Mabon” for this sabbat is actually a modern invention.

### Historical Roots of Harvest Celebrations

Across many cultures, the time of the autumn equinox has been marked with festivals that celebrate the second harvest, a crucial period for gathering resources before the onset of winter. Historical events like the week-long Greek festival, the Eleusinian Mysteries which revolved around Demeter and Persephone, reflect similar themes of life, death, and rebirth—key aspects of the harvest that influence Mabon’s symbolism.

### Modern Naming and Celebration

The name “Mabon” was introduced to the Wheel of the Year in the 1970s by Aidan Kelly, co-founder of the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn, as part of a systematic approach to revive and balance the modern Pagan Wheel of the Year. He chose the name from Welsh mythology—Mabon ap Modron, which means
“Son of the Mother,” reflecting themes of release, liberation, and balance. This newer designation connects the sabbat to the mythological tale of Mabon, a divine youth whose story is about liberation and triumph over darkness, mirroring the equinox’s balance of light and shadow.

### A Season of Abundance and Thanksgiving

As the Autumn Equinox brings equal day and night, Mabon stands as a poignant reminder of balance and reciprocity. This festival is pivotal for farmers and all who cherish the earth’s bounty, as it’s the period when the success of the season’s crops is assessed. The health of livestock and the yield of crops determined the well-being of the community through winter. Such practical realities made Mabon a crucial time for giving thanks.
This sabbat is celebrated with gatherings, feasts, and rituals that express gratitude for the earth’s plentiful harvest. It is a time to honor the efforts that have led to fruitful yields and to acknowledge the shifting balance towards the darker, cooler days ahead. Families and communities come together to share food and drink, celebrating the abundance provided by the earth and the labor of those who cultivate it.

### Reflecting on Harmony and Preparation

Mabon is not only a time for celebration but also for reflection and preparation. It encourages contemplation of life’s balances—light with dark, activity with rest, and abundance with scarcity. This equilibrium is reflected in the equal length of day and night during the equinox. In this sense, Mabon mirrors the theme of balance seen in the earlier spring equinox festival, Ostara, but with a focus on gratitude and the harvesting of blessings.
This sabbat serves as a reminder to cherish and utilize the abundance currently available while preparing for the leaner times winter may bring. It’s a time to make the most of the remaining warmth and light, gathering resources and fortifying homes against the coming cold, all while giving thanks for the year’s bounty and the people with whom we share it.
