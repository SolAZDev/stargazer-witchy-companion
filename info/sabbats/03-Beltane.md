## What is Beltane

Beltane is a Pagan Gaelic fire festival celebrated May 1st, marking the vibrant transition from spring to summer. Beltane stands at the midpoint between the spring equinox and the summer solstice, heralding the light half of the year.
Unlike the modern astronomical definition of seasons, which places the start of summer at the June solstice, Beltane is based on the traditional agrarian calendar. This calendar observes the beginning of summer from the evidence of nature itself—increased warmth, the blooming of plants, and the fertile earth ready to sow crops.

Beltane is more than just a celebration of the arrival of summer; it is an acknowledgment of the ever-changing cycles of nature and a reminder to embrace the warmth, light, and abundance the season brings. By honoring Beltane, we connect with our ancestral roots and the enduring beauty of the earth.

## The Goddesses of Beltane

Several goddesses are associated with the themes of fertility, growth, and love that Beltane celebrates. The nature of Celtic mythology, with its emphasis on the cyclical and interconnected aspects of life, means that many deities can be relevant to the themes of Beltane. Here are a couple of examples:

- **Flora**; At the heart of Beltane’s lush celebrations stands Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers, spring, and fertility. Her essence is interwoven with the very fabric of Beltane, embodying the festival’s vibrant celebration of life, renewal, and the blossoming of the natural world. As the goddess who breathes life into spring’s floral tapestry, Flora symbolizes the abundance and beauty that Beltane heralds.

- **Aine**; Aine is an Irish goddess often associated with summer, wealth, sovereignty, and fertility. She is particularly connected to the sun and the energy it brings to encourage growth. As a goddess of love and fertility, Aine’s connection to Beltane is through the vitalizing power of the sun and the fertility of the land. Celebrations in her honor involve lighting torches or bonfires, which aligns with Beltane’s fire rituals.

- **Brigid**; Although Brigid is more traditionally linked with Imbolc, her themes of fertility, inspiration, and the protective and healing aspects of fire make her relevant to Beltane as well. Brigid embodies the light half of the year, and her sacred flames and wells represent purification and renewal—key aspects of the Beltane celebration.

- **May Queen, or Maiden Goddess**; While not a specific named deity, the May Queen personifies the earth in bloom, the perfect symbol for Beltane’s celebration of spring’s full swing. Imagine Mother Nature in her prom dress, if you will.
