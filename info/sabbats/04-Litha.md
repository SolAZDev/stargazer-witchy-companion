## What is Litha?

Litha is a Pagan holiday celebrated on the Summer Solstice, typically around June 20th.

Pagans honor this time with festivities that embrace the sun’s power, symbolizing growth, prosperity, and renewal.

## Litha Deities

If you’re ready to party like it’s the longest day of the year, you’re in luck because Litha’s guest list is straight-up celestial. This summer solstice festival is all about high vibes, with the sun reaching its peak, and it’s not just beachgoers and BBQ enthusiasts who get in on the action—some pretty powerful deities are also center stage. Here’s a closer look at the divine figures traditionally honored during this vibrant celebration, each embodying the light and life that define Midsummer.

- **Ra: The Egyptian Sun God**; Ra is the ancient Egyptian deity of the sun, ruling over all parts of the created world, both the sky and the earth. Often depicted traveling across the sky in a solar boat, Ra’s journey represents the sun’s path each day. During Litha, his dominance in the sky is at its maximum, making him a central figure in celebrations that focus on the power and life-giving qualities of the sun.

- **Apollo: Greek God of the Light**; Apollo, one of the most multifaceted figures of Greek mythology, is not only the god of the sun but also of healing, music, and prophecy. His association with light and the sun makes him a fitting deity to honor during Litha, celebrating the clarity and brightness that characterize the peak of summer. Festivities in his name might include music and poetic recitals, highlighting his cultural and artistic domains.

- **Baldur: The Norse God of Light and Purity**; Baldur is revered in Norse mythology as the god of light, joy, and purity. His myth, involving his death due to a mistletoe arrow and subsequent resurrection, symbolizes the cycle of growth, decay, and rebirth. Litha, occurring at a time of intense light and life, resonates deeply with Baldur’s themes of light overcoming darkness, making his story particularly relevant to Midsummer celebrations.

- **Brigid: Irish Goddess of Fire and Fertility**; Though traditionally associated with Imbolc, Brigid’s fiery aspects make her a fitting deity for Litha as well. She embodies the forge and hearth, representing the transformative power of fire. Her roles as a goddess of fertility and healing also connect deeply with Litha’s themes of growth and renewal, celebrating the flourishing of nature at summer’s peak.

- **Freya: Norse Goddess of Love and Fertility**; Freya, a major goddess in Norse mythology, rules over love, beauty, and fertility. Celebrating Freya during Litha involves honoring the abundance and fertility of the earth, which are at their zenith. Her connection to love and beauty makes Litha rituals of partnership and community especially poignant, reflecting the social and nurturing aspects of the season.

- **The Oak King and The Holly King**; The myth of the Oak King and the Holly King symbolizes the changing of the seasons. The Oak King, who rules from Yule to Litha, and the Holly King, who takes over from Litha to Yule, represent the dual nature of the sun’s journey. Their battle at Litha, which leads to the victory of the Holly King, marks the turning point where the light begins to wane, making this a key narrative in the Litha celebration that highlights the cyclical nature of the seasons.

## Traditional Litha Foods

Let’s delve into the delicious world of traditional Litha foods, which typically spotlight the fresh, vibrant produce of the season:

- **Berries:** Midsummer is the peak time for many berries, including strawberries and raspberries. They can be eaten fresh, baked into pies or tarts, or made into jams to preserve the taste of summer.
- **Honey:** As a celebration of the sun and its light, it’s no surprise that honey, the golden nectar created by sun-loving bees, has a special place in Litha feasts.
- **Mead:** Mead, a fermented beverage made from honey, water, and yeast, has a long-standing connection to Litha. Known as the “nectar of the gods,” mead is often consumed during summer solstice celebrations as a symbol of the season’s abundance and the sun’s warmth. Many modern Litha revelers continue to enjoy this honeyed drink as part of their festivities.
- **Herbs and Fresh Vegetables:** The summer solstice is a time of abundance, with gardens overflowing with fresh herbs and veggies. Salads, grilled vegetables, and herb-infused dishes often grace Litha tables.
- **Fire-Roasted Foods:** Given the tradition of lighting bonfires, foods that can be roasted on a fire, like corn on the cob, various types of meat, or even marshmallows, are also a fitting choice for a Litha feast.
- **Sun-Shaped Foods:** Foods that resemble the sun, such as round bread or pastries, sun-shaped cookies, or circular fruits like oranges, are another fun way to celebrate the longest day of the year.
- **Drinks:** Herbal teas, summer wines, and fruity punches can help toast to the sun’s zenith.
  These foods not only celebrate the summer season’s bounty but also pay homage to the sun with its vibrant colors and association with light and warmth.
